Hi, Iâ€™m Tina! I'm a first-year Math of Computation major at UCLA. 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software roles; especially full-stack and back-end. Looking for summer/fall 2022 internships; either paid or unpaid! 

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning React, Java, C++, and Python. I'm a great team-player and would love the opportunity to grow and hone my skills in an early-career role. 

ðŸ“« You can find me at tinatjma@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinatjma/ -- would love to chat!
